# BeaconOS

> *Forged by Raymond. Lit for the ones still searching.*

**BeaconOS** is a **hobbyist operating system** built from scratch to **teach**, to **reveal**, and to **light the path** into the low-level world of OS development. It's not bloated with abstractions or hidden behind layers of magic. Every line exists for a reason. Every component is a lesson.

**Note:** This is a work in progress.
